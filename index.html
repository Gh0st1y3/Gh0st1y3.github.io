<center>My BSCSIA Experience at Western Governors University (WGU)</center><br>
<center>by Shelly Bailey</center><br>
<p>
In March of 2023, I completed the Western Governors University Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.  I accelerated through the degree in a nine-month timeframe, and this is a write-up of my experience.  Disclaimer: I do not work for WGU, I am just an alumna that had an overall enjoyable experience that I would like to share and hopefully inspire others that are interested in pursuing this path.
<p>
What is your background?
Right out of high school, I was hired into the public education sector where I have remained for 25 years.  I started in IT as a technology secretary and proceeded to progress in the field for 15 years, holding titles such as help desk associate, desktop support technician, and systems/network administration. My IT training was learned on the job and through using online resources such as Pluralsight.  After many years in the work force, I completed my associate degree in business management and graduated as an adult student with a Magna Cum Laude designation in 2021. I am currently working full time in systems administration in the K-12 sector.
<p>
Why WGU? 
Previously having completed my associate degree online through a local community college, I knew that online schooling was the most appropriate for me. I wanted to continue my secondary education with a bachelor’s degree but did not want to spend several years obtaining it or to be burdened with a mountain of debt. As single mother of a teenager (who already has her own college aspirations), and with a full-time career; I needed convenience and affordability and wanted a degree path that would enable me to grow in my current career field.  WGU met all these requirements, providing the ability to work at my own pace as well as the ability to accelerate through a degree with their competency-based learning model.  
<p>
Why the BSCSIA?
During my career as a technology professional, I have been exposed to just about every aspect of the IT field. Along the way, I developed an interest in information security and cyber defense. My employer was undergoing the process of obtaining cyber liability insurance and there were various steps we needed to take to qualify for the insurance coverage. Several of these initiatives became my responsibility as our organization’s sole systems administrator. As I proceeded to implement these various initiatives it occurred to me the best way to fulfill my desire of completing a bachelor’s degree while simultaneously validating and enhancing the skills that I was building from the implementations I was performing at work, that a Cybersecurity degree path was the way to go. WGU’s BSCSIA program not only provides you with a bachelor’s degree, but also with several industry certifications from Axelos, CompTIA, and ISC2 along the way. WGU is accredited through the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) and is also designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.

How I paid for school
My goal was to attend school debt free, and I accomplished that goal. First, I completed the FAFSA and qualified for a small Pell grant. This grant was divided up over two terms. Next, I applied for various scholarships through WGU’s Scholarship Universe. Fortunately, I had been inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa honor society at my previous school and was awarded a scholarship through this organization. I utilized $1250 in scholarships from PTK which was also divided over two terms. For the balance of the tuition, I enrolled in WGU’s interest free payment system (monthly payments divided across a 6-month term that I paid for out of pocket with a $55 setup fee). I enrolled in the payment program for both of my terms. Finally, I spoke with my employer and was able to work out a tuition reimbursement deal.  My employer fully reimbursed my remaining tuition with an agreement that I would pay them back if I were to separate from employment within a 2-year time frame from my completion date. With this combination of assistance, I was able to graduate with no debt.

Enrollment process
After researching various schools, reviewing copious YouTube videos, subreddits and blogs, I decided that WGU was the best choice to help me obtain my goals. I started the process of enrolling at WGU in March of 2022.  I submitted the application and had the $65 enrollment fee waived as part of a promotion on their website. A few hours after I submitted my application my enrollment counselor contacted me for a brief interview. She asked questions about why I was interested in WGU, why I was choosing the cybersecurity degree path, what my previous education and experience looked like, what I did for a career and what my support network looked like.  During the next few weeks, we met over the phone one time per week as the enrollment counselor walked me through the various steps of enrolling: including obtaining and submitting my previous transcripts, figuring out transfer credits, completing the FAFSA, submitting applications to scholarships and setting up a payment plan.  The final step was to complete my intake interview and make my first tuition payment. On April 26, 2022, I was cleared to start the BSCSIA program, and my start date was scheduled for June 1, 2022.

Transfer credits
I transferred in my AAS of Business Management. WGU applied the credits I earned from this degree to the BSCSIA and it effectively eliminated all of my general education requirements (36 credit hours).  Additionally, I had previously obtained the Google IT Support Certificate and transferred that in as well which eliminated the Introduction to IT course (and an additional 4 credit hours).  I was left with 85 credit hours and 23 classes to complete at WGU.
<p>
Completing Classes
WGU starts your first term off with Orientation, then you are allowed to open your first four classes. You may complete those four classes at your own pace, but you must finish them within the current six-month term. I finished my first four classes within the first few weeks. I contacted my mentor and had her open a new course for me as I finished the previous one. I was allowed to have a maximum of 2 courses open at a time.  I finished 18 classes in the first six-month term and finished the remaining 5 classes in my second six-month term.  I did not fail any of the Objective Assessments (OA’s) and earned three Excellence certificates for written works in three of my classes.  Several of the OA’s are completed by sitting for various industry certification exams (for example, passing the CompTIA Network+ certification not only meant you were certified, but meant you also passed the C480 Networks course). Other classes are proctored through an online testing center and I took those exams within the comfort of my own home office. You are notified immediately if you passed or failed an exam. If you passed an exam, the course is completed and removed from your schedule.
<p>
Mentorship
I had three different mentors.  My first mentor was fantastic and encouraged my acceleration. We started off with weekly phone calls and then switched to bi-weekly phone calls with an email update in between since I was in good academic standing. She was there if I needed her, but not overbearing. I contacted her via text message or email when I needed a new course opened and I never had to wait more than a day for a response. This mentor was with me my entire first term until she announced she was leaving WGU. When she left, I only had five classes left and was starting my second term when I was assigned a new mentor.  This mentor did an introductory call with me when she initially took on my case and then rarely followed up or responded to messages except for an automated “congratulations” email when I passed an OA. Luckily, mentor #1 had already opened my remaining classes so I didn’t need to depend on mentor #2 to do so. When I was down to two classes left, mentor #2 took a leave of absence and I worked with her sub (mentor #3) who was again wonderful and saw me through the remainder of my classes, she was very quick to answer questions and give support when needed.  When I was down to just my capstone left, my 2nd mentor returned, and I found myself in the same situation as before. Regardless, I finished my classes, and the 2nd mentor did recommend me for graduation the same day I finished my capstone so my graduation was not held up. 
<p>
Graduation
I completed the IT capstone on March 2, 2023.  When I received notification that I had cleared the course, I contacted my mentor and asked to be recommended for graduation.  My mentor sent a graduation application/survey for me to complete.  On March 12, 2023, I was notified by the Graduation department that my graduation application had been approved and I had received the Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.  I was notified that my diploma and transcripts were sent on March 16, 2023 and the same day I received an email link to my downloadable transcripts. 
WGU holds graduation ceremonies across the United States as well as virtual ceremonies and you are allowed to attend a ceremony of your choosing. The closest ceremony to my graduation date as well as in closest physical proximity to me is Washington D.C. in April, 2023.  I completed the online RSVP process and was approved to attend commencement. I am looking forward to walking with my peers in the Nation’s Capital and attending the Alumni party that is scheduled for that weekend.
<p>
How long did it take?
From the start of Orientation to the completion of my capstone, 274 days.
<p>
Outside resources that I used
I used Udemy, Pluralsight, Linked in Learning (WGU provides subscriptions to these three platforms). I have a personal subscription to O’Reilly Safari Books which I used for practice tests. I also followed various YouTube channels, subreddits, and purchased a variety of physical and eBooks for my own collection. I signed up for a TryHackMe subscription (you can get a student discount with a .edu address for $8 per month) and spend a couple hours per week working on those rooms. I also attended in-person security conferences.

Acceleration and other tips?
If you are not self-motivated and disciplined, this degree path is probably not for you. If you do not have a passion for technology, you probably will not get value from this program. If you do not enjoy life-long learning, the technology field overall is not right for you. I was able to accelerate the remainder of my credit hours due to many hours of study time that I put in (20-30 hours per week), late nights, early mornings, prior experience in the IT field and a burning desire to learn. I never passed up an opportunity to study or learn something new. I spent my lunch hours in coffee shops studying.  I have about an hour commute to and from work each day and spent the commute listening to videos over the car’s speakers.  When I needed a break from study materials, I listed to cybersecurity podcasts, read blogs, watched YouTube videos, and read security related books, anything I could do to immerse myself in the cybersecurity discipline.

If you have questions about a particular course, utilize your course instructor, the course chatter, WGU Cybersecurity Facebook and Discord groups, the WGU IT Facebook group, the WGU Discord, and best of all, search for your course number on Reddit.  The WGU Cybersecurity community always has someone willing to help.
<p>
What is next on my agenda?
I am in the process of enrolling for the Masters of Cybersecurity and Information Assurance degree with a target start date of June 1, 2023.  I am working on the Microsoft 365 Security Administrator Associate certification and reviewing CISSP study materials.
